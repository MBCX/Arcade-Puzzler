**Welcome to the 1.1.00 minor upgrade!** This minor upgrade is primarily focused on fixing a few of the issues you might have encountered while playing the game. And to also add new small fine tunes, and smoothen the overall gameplay experience. Here's a list of what has been fixed/added in this new version.

* **BUG fixes**
    1. **All Modern Browsers**
        * Fix most sound issues.
        * Fix issue in standard reversed mode. The number table would click to the correct look once all pieces loaded, that looked weird.
        * Fix keyboard navigation through the number table (for keyboard users).
        * Fixed issue where after enough time, some pages may not load. Therefore breaking the game.
        * Fixed a not consistent behaviour with carousel buttons when picking a game configuration, where they sometimes appear, never disappear or never appear.
    2. **Firefox**
        * Fixed issue where the number table didn't look correct while playing in vertical or vertical reversed modes.
    3. **Safari**
        * Fixed issue where the time, movements and configuration mode were not centred horizontally.
        * Fixed dangerous bug where moving certain pieces in the number table would soft lock the game.
        
* **NEW features**
    1. **Gameplay**
        * Added which game mode you're playing.
        * Changed sound of moving tiles.
        * Tiles are now animated when moved! (Default behaviour, but can be changed in the new options menu for maximum precision).
    2. **General**
        * Replaced "Exit Game" button with **the new Options menu**.
        * Changed game icon. Old one was rubbish.
        * Customise the game's appearance with 4 different colour themes! (Light, dark, retro and automatic).
